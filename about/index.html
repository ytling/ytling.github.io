    <h1 class="article-title">About Me</h1>

    

    <div class="article-content">
      <p>A brief introduction to myself,  I graduated from York University in statistics, BA in Year 2018 and completed the master of Biostatistics at University of Toronto in year 2019. After graduated, I started as an intern associate in TD bank. After 8 months, I received a full-time position as an IT support analyst and left in November 2020.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why I choose the biostatisics program after graduate from York University? my personal interest in reading paper on the human&rsquo;s health and curiosity on the statistics behind.</li>
<li>Why I left the bank? to continuous my passion on health care data.</li>
<li>What can I bring to the world? I am keen in learning new technique to solve the coming trouble, mostly coming from people. Also, I feel accomplishment when putting mess into a tidyverse.</li>
<li>Who is the person/group of people I admire and adore now?  developer/engineer/artist, <a href="https://github.com/yihui">Yihui Xie</a> etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for many people on my growing: I met many aggressive and passion folks in TD bank and completed my little financial model using data from the market data with their huge assist. And I want to express my gratitution to group of intelligent scientist in Public Health Ontario and the chance of working with the nutrition data to explore the relationship between parental education and sodium intake for young children.</p>
<p>If you have some interesting problems/issues/questions, please find <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lynne-lin-9bb919100/">my contact information</a>, as well as my resume.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
