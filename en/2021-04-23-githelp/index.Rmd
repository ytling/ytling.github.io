#  git help everyday


```
Changes not staged for commit:
```

when we `git add` the files exit in the repo but changes, we need to tell git which file needs to add. We can use  

0. `git add <file>...` to include in what want to be committed 

1. `git add -u :/`: add all modified file changes to the stage.

2. `git add * :/`: add modified and any new files to the stage.
