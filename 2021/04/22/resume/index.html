<p>To who may read</p>
<p>I am writing to express my keen interest in the Junior Data Science Developer role in the HQ 790 bay, Toronto, ON.</p>
<p>About me: I am an open-minded person with high curiosity to natural object, denoted by human. I respect in the impact of gene and environment and try single healthy experiment on myself to understand some hard theories. Also, a human working Single-threaded process, by this, I mean my quaintly of the work done has negative(? linear) relationship with the number of the work in one unit of the time.</p>
<p>Please allow me to state my interest and love of this job in a descending order. Comparing to lots of categories of data nowadays, I find my passion on the health care organizations and HQ is one of them. Secondly, a job which brings well-being to people is the biggest motivation for me to occur the difficulties in daily tasks. Lastly, office of the HQ is actually 1 min away from home and I am a little happy and surprise about that, so does my best friend he used she.</p>
<p>Add-in, I start my first blog after leaving last position. I personally love the minimal theme with simple content without redundant images and widgets. Our home page matches my taste. Although I can not say high skilled in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, I find it is an interesting and can not wait to leverage them in my next job.</p>
<p>best,</p>
<p>Ling Lin</p>
