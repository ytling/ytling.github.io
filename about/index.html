    <h1 class="article-title">About Me</h1>

    

    <div class="article-content">
      <p>A brief introduction to myself,  I graduated from York University in statistics, BA in Year 2018. After that, I joined the unversity of toronto and completed the master of Biostatistics  in year 2019. After graduated, I luckily worked in the TD bank as an intern associate as my first job. After 8 months, I received a full-time position as an IT support analyst and left the bank in November 2020.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why I choose the biostatisics program after graduate from York University? my personal interest in reading paper on the human&rsquo;s health and curiosity on the statistics behind.</li>
<li>Why I left the bank? to continuous my passion on health care data. What can I bring to IC/ES? I am high skilled in developing code in R and python. Also, I feel accomplishment when putting date into a tidy table.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I gaint some pratice in cleaning market data in TD bank in one and half years. Besides, during the praticum in public health ontario, my main contribution was about the analysis of the relationship between parental education and sodium intake in SAS. If you are interested in more about me, please find my contact information, as well as my resume.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<p>Ling Lin</p>
