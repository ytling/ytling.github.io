      <description>Leedcode 67: Add BinaryGiven two string a and b, return their sum as a binary string.
Input: a = &amp;#39;101&amp;#39;, b = &amp;#39;111&amp;#39;Output: &amp;#39;1100&amp;#39;Idea:1. ans can use list and string as the result in a string.if use the string: +if use the list need to add the &#34;&#34;.join()[::-1] at the end
while loop instead the for loop: the length is unsure, both use the index</description>

      <description>Some concepts and examples in Experimental Design
experimental study: a study subject is assigned the treatmentobservational study: a study with subject is observed or measuredexperimental unit: in an experimental study, basic entity can be assigned is called experimental unit. The experimental unit is people, called subject. At observational and experimental study, subjects are called participants.
Experimental DesignA good experimental design will need:1. treatments are random assigned to the experimental unit.</description>

      <description>SQLYou are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

For this problem we will begin with the sashelp.baseball data set.</description>

      <description>R MarkdownThis is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
